* An image of the pet;
* A physical description of the pet;

When I visit the adoption page, I can only see the pet that is next in line to be adopted.
I can see a list of other people currently in line.
* I can submit my name and be added to the end of the line.
* When I am not at the beginning of the line, I cannot see an option to adopt a pet.
* For demo purposes: Once I join the line, I can see other pets being adopted until I am at the front of the line.
    * Every five seconds, the user at the front of the line should be removed from the line and one of the pets up for adoption should disappear.
    * When I am at the front of the line, a new user should be added to the line behind me every five seconds until there are a total of five users in line.

-------------

* When I am at the front of the line:

* I can see an option to adopt a pet.
* When I choose to adopt a pet: 
    * I see a confirmation that I have adopted the pet.
    * I see my name removed from the line.
    * I see the pet I adopted is removed from view and replaced with another pet.
